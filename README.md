# Chat GPT Based Ai chat bot on discord 
Yes gpt is popping out everywhere lol . So i tried implement it on discord bot . 

## How to do it ?
download this repo or use it using the git clone and intall the requirements from the pip requirements file on this repo
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then create a api from the open ai and gen a bot tocken and run the code if any problum just dm me on [discordServer](https://discord.com/invite/bT8jhUykVS). And aslo set a dotenv file on your project file like the way did on [example.env](https://github.com/ilynivin/aichatbot/blob/main/example.env) *remove example from a dotenvfile*
